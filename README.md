================

This Vim / NeoVim plugin solves a "personal problem" editing workflow issue at
the intersection of ctags, FZF, and language clients. It probably won't be
nearly as helpful to people who aren't me.

A huge debt of gratitude to [zackhsi/fzf-tags][0], the plugin that inspired this
one, and whose code I borrowed to get it started.
